# todo
 - populate the example clips folder
 - write the tutorial code
 - Think about splitting up chunks into 1.5 secs for both evaluators and ml

# Plan:

Explain example of each : 

Stuttering event labels:
    Prolongation: Elongated syllable (e.g., M[mmm]ommy)
    Block: Gasps for air or stuttered pauses
    Sound Repetition: Repeated syllables (e.g., I [pr-pr-pr-]prepared dinner)
    Word Repetition: The same word or phrase is repeated (e.g., I made [made] dinner)
    Interjection: Common filler words such as "um" or "uh" or person-specific filler words that individuals use to cope with their stutter (e.g., some users frequently say "you know" as a filler).

Give an example wav clip of each

Explain that you should not mark sections which could be labelled as the following 
Additional labels:

Unsure: An annotator selects this if they are not confident in their labeling.
Poor Audio Quality: It is difficult to understand due to, for example, microphone quality.
Difficult To Understand: It is difficult to understand the speech.
Natural Pause: There is a pause in speech that is not considered a block or other disfluency.
Music: There is background music playing
No Speech: There is no speech in this clip. It is either silent or there is just background noise.

think of these as fluent clips

Give an example wav clip of each


Then run quick test of playing a wav and making them select what type of what label it would get - e.g fluent or prolong, or block or rep etc...

If they get 5 right, allow them to move on

Then explain the test:They should click the mark button every tmie they hear a dysfluent event - i.e. any of prolong, or block or rep etc... they do not need to mark exactly what type it is, but its good they know exactly what we class it as. They should note that we will clean and group their clicks so they should not worry about clicking too much in a short space of time, for example if they hear a set of word repetitions for example, they can click as often as they like, say every repetition, or just once. If a stutter laster for more than a few seconds, please press again.
